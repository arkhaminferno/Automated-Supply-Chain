# Automated-Supply-Chain

## My Pitch
As we can see in traditional supply chain systems there are Multiple Parties involved between payment and dispatch and i think in this scenario blockchain could shine.
A smart Contract where Payments and Dispatch systems might work via event triggers in the ethereum blockchain.

- lets say a new item that costs 1 ether and we want to track the item via the blockchain and in this case i want to have a specific address where this item can be paid to and that happens by the customer.

- An item gets created via the smart contract and we get an address back of the item via event triggers.
- A customer has to transfer specific amount of money to the product address.(Its like sending ether from one address to another in order to buy  item).
- After payment we can do withdrawl that happens by the customer and Dispatch event will trigger.
